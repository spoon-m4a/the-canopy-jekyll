# 4.d3a Sometimes Slow is Fast

I could stand to remember this sometimes. Maybe we all could.

Often I find myself in a hurry to do things and that will in turn cause more pain and suffering for me. Taking a moment to breathe and just sort of… be helps me a lot.

Taking the time to do that helps a LOT.
