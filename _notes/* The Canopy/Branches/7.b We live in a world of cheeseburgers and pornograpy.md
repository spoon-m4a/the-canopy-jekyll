# 7. We live in a world of cheeseburgers and pornograpy

This was a line that #folks/Bobby_Thomas put in one of his poems back in undergrad, and it has stuck with me ever since. We really *do* live in a world like that. He was writing that pre-covid (god, that was five and a half years ago) and it's only felt truer as time passes.
