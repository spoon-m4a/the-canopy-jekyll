# Take Care of the Obvious Stuff First

I have to write this down because even though it's *obvious* it isn't always *easy*. One of the ways I navigate my [[10.a Hidden costs of mental illness]] is by doing what is obvious because my executive dysfunction makes anything else untenable.

Have you eaten? Have you showered? Have you been getting enough sleep?

I think it's why songs like #people/Johnnie_Frierson's "[Have You Been Good to Yourself](https://youtu.be/sgo4KegZp3k?si=t42fMunyF8GwueyK)" is so powerful. Speak plainly; ask questions that seem to have simple answers.

Most likely you can find some answers there, and even if you can't at the very least you've improved your quality of life.
