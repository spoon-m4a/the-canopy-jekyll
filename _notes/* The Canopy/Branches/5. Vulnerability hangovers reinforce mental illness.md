# 5. Vulnerability Hangovers Reinforce Mental Illness

When reading an article I was reintroduced to the term after a while of not really using it.

I can feel how true this is for me.

It’s hard to be vulnerable when the act of doing so

Makes me feel almost physically tired. I think this is why when I have a hard conversation with someone I feel like I absolutely need to take a break or lie down or unplug or something.
