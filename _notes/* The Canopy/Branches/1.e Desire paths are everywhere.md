# 1.e Desire Paths Are Everywhere

I love desire paths. I love how they really make me feel like there's a sense of time to a place. I can literally walk where dozens or hundreds of people have walked, and in so doing I contribute to it.

Desire paths have an important function in how things move around an environment. We're used to the image of a path through a patch of grass to avoid a corner or something, but to me it's a little more than just that. It's about a flow of energy, in particular a flow of energy that allows an agent to retain as much of it as it can.

Desire paths are ways of thought, cookies in a browser, rivers and valleys, and if we get really broad, evolution can be said to be a desire path across time and space.

A powerful framing device for the [[1.f Digital Garden]].
