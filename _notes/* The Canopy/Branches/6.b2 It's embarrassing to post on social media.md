# 6.b2 It's Embarrassing to Post on Social Media

Maybe one of the reasons for why [[5.a1 Posting ennui is the new normal]] can be found in the fact that a lot of people (myself included) feel a sort of quiet shame in sharing their lives on the social internet.

[[3. Millennials are weird]] and they're becoming more of an outlier.[^1] I remember having a conversation with #folks/Michelle_Zimmerman about that when her and #folks/Emmet_Moberly-LaChance were down here last. We both resonated with the idea that somehow we feel it's a little [[cringe]] to share stuff the way wee used to, and the way that social media companies expect us to.

I'm willing to bet that in more than a few ways media companies are working on some outdated information about how and why people use the social internet.

## Crossings

[^1]: The generations before them notwithstanding; Gen X and Boomer cohorts aren't considered "digital natives" in the same way.
