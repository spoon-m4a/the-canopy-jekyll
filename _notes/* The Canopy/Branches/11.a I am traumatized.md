# 11.a I Am Traumatized

I am so very traumatized by all kinds of things. Some I don't think I have the courage to write down, others are so commonplace that to write them down feels asinine. But I need to change my identity about this stuff; I need to reframe myself and the story that I tell about myself, because I have changed and been changing for long enough that a reevaluation is long overdue.
