# The Dead Internet Theory Feels Real

The fact that we can't differentiate between bots and humans, even before [[20230205214801-ChatGPT|ChatGPT]], feels important to me somehow. Because [[6.f1 the internet flattens things out]], the sense of humanity and personhood becomes reduced, deflagrated in such a way that any semblance of relatability takes on a form of unreality, and the collective hallucinations that we experience as tangible "things" on the internet present us with a dissonance that's hard to articulate but very much felt. In other words, our minds are telling us one thing, and our bodies the other (after all, [[8. The body is the bedrock]] and it [[The Body Keeps the Score]]).
