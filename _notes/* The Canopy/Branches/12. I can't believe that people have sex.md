# 12. I Can't Believe That People Have Sex

I am in a gas station, looking around, and I just can't believe it. Everyone you meet; the folks walking around caring crazy, the cashiers at the gas station, politicians, coworkers. I just can't believe it.

Is that crazy? I guess I just have such an intimate relationship with it (obviously) that the idea of someone else having anything even remotely like it feels so bizarre; to imagine that the people I see have similarly powerful moments. I guess what I'm talking about are [[12.a Empathy mechanisms]]
