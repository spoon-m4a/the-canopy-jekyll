# 5.a1 Posting Ennui is the New Normal

I read an article [here](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/are-you-experiencing-posting-ennui) that talks about how people are, more and more, not feeling like they want to post less and lurk more. [[3. Millennials are weird]] so they're not feeling as much of this, and it's disproportionately affecting the younger people on the internet.
