# 4.d Automation can stifle creativity

I think about this a lot especially in the context of my notes. I think that it's true for a lot of other things. 

Offloading your thinking is a great way to get more things done. There are too many things in the [[attention economy]] that are competing for our attention and time, and to try and capture all of that is simply too much. 

But [[4.d1 Don't optimize the fun away]]  engaging with things with your own two hands is a critical point of living and being. Don't be so focused on the "doing" part. Get messy. Get frustrated.
