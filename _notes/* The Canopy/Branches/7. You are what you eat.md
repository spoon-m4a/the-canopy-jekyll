# You Are What You Eat

It's a funny phrase, I think, because i think more and more lately we need to apply that logic to our so-called "media diet." 

I don't usually like that term (media diet) because not only does describing the things you see somewhere on a screen as "content" [[7.a1 Content is made to deliver advertisement Art is made to deliver meaning|feel bad to me]], it also makes me feel weird about the disconnect i feel around the language of "consumption." [[7.a You don't consume media, you experience it]]

But in this case it helps me reframe some things. Like how [[2025-08-16_Sa|yesterday]] I went to a concert (because of some serendipitous circumstances!) and today i felt inspired to actually create some music for the first time. Or how now that I've been reading more, I've been more motivated to write more.

What goes in has to come out, in some form. Mostly people try to have this coming and going *intentional*, because your body will cycle through it naturally; but if you aren't paying attention, you'll do what all bodies do when they are undernourished: prioritize easy, brain pleasing calories at the expense of more "long term" health needs.
