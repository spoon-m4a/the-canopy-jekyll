# 6.b1 What Do Influencers Influence?

I know that it’s a kind of stupid question; but it just makes me think about how we are redefining words faster than we are understanding them.

I guess I feel like our brains can’t keep up with our mouths.

I don't think that people often think about the implications of that. [[Words are important]] and I feel like that term, "influencer," is so loaded with meanings generated in the last 12 to 15 years that I don't think a lot of people fully appreciate it.
