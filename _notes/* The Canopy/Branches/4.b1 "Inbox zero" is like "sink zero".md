# 4.b1 "Inbox Zero" is Like Sink Zero

I don't mean this disparagingly (at least not *entirely*). Inbox zero is a concept and practice that I see a lot in [[th.PKM]] spaces, and while I think that overall it's a good idea, I just don't think that it's realistic in most scenarios.

Like, I know that there are genuinely people out there that don't leave dishes in their sinks overnight, and I think that it's a great aspiration, a good motivator to envision what you can strive for and accomplish. I guess that a lot of the time when people try to live for that they're looking for a fix of some kind, but remember: [[4.b1a PKM can be intellectual masturbation]], and [[4.b1b PKM cannot save you]]
