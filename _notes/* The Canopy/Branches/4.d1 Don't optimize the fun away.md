# 4.d1 Don't Optimize the Fun Away

#people/Sid_Meier has a quote about this:

> [!quote]
> Given the chance, most players will optimize the fun out of a game. One of the responsibilities of a designer is to protect players from themselves.

I think that especially in the world of [[th.PKM]] people are liable to do this. Not only is it true that [[4.d Automation can stifle creativity]], but spending time to optimize things takes away the energy you might have to actually *do* the thing.

If you spend all your time doing things the “right” way, you aren’t giving yourself the chance to actually figure out what is you need. [[4.d2 Get messy sometimes]]. I like to think that if I run into the same problem multiple times in a row, and feel frustrated about it, I will think about how to maybe speed up certain processes.

Contrast against [[4.d3 Speeding things up is usually worth]]
