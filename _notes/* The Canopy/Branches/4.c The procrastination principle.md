# 4.c Procrastination Principle

#research

First encountered [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia?wprov=sfti1) on [[Wikipedia]], funnily enough, on the Wiki article about, well, Wikipedia. It is defined there as:

> The procrastination principle dictates that one should wait for problems to arise before solving them.

Coined in reference to things on the [[6. The internet is insane|Internet]]. Probably has some sort of relationship to [[th.PKM]] applications, and I can definitely see how it refers to my personal life; I talked with #folks/Valine_Zeigler about this a lot when it comes to how guides work at [[20220227130242-EMA|EMA]].
