# 6. The Internet is Insane

The internet has been the closest thing to a Pandora's Box that humanity has created. Here I attempt to draw threads between it and the rest of my ideas. Not only is it insane, I think that it *makes us* insane.

I saw a video of #people/Hank_Green's a while ago where he referred to our modern day internet, the part that most people experience, as the "social internet". I think that this is the part of the internet most people refer to when they talk about the "dead internet" theory; [[6.f The dead internet theory feels real]].

Contrast with [[6.a The (anti)social internet]].
