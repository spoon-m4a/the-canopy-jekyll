# Content is Made to Deliver Advertisement; Art is Made to Deliver Meaning

Death of the author? More like [[death-of-the-content-creator]]. "Content creator" feels like a betrayal to me; to willingly call oneself a "creator" one draw the unfortunate comparison of self aggrandizing narcissistic pseudo micro-celebrity-as-deity while signposting oneself as a happy cog in a machine that's spinning so powerfully you enthusiastically become warped by it.
