# Masculinity is a Constraining Force

In accordance with the writing of (the amazing) #people/Bell_Hooks and inspired by my conversation with Trey [[2025-08-07_Th|today]], it for me thinking about how the concept of “masculinity” as it stands really acts as a limiting force on those that intersect with it.

It might *feel* like it allows for more freedom, but it really creates additional rules for th involved to follow.
