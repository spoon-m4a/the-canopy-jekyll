# Metaphors for Describing the Vault

It's been on my mind for awhile now; what is the overarching narrative thread that describes the vault to me? If it could change chape, what would that shape be? If it could speak, what would it describe about itself first? These are the questions that i'm asking here! [[20220420224144-The-Vault-as-mind]] is one attempt at describing it, [[20220528075850-The-vault-as-place]] is another, and related to [[20220517064517-Zettelkasten-as-space]]

Had a discussion on the [[Obsidian-discord]] about this, and it helped clarify some things. I think there are some helpful questions that can help guide my thinking:

1. What are the *features* of my notes?
2. What's most important to me?
3. Does this description feel joyful, and encourage use?

There are probably better ways to ask them, or simply better questions, but here we are. I suppose this is a bit of a #dump but perhaps more structured.

## What Are the Features of My Notes?

My notes contain lots of different things. They are more than simply journals, class notes, todo lists, [[Zettelkasten]], or any particularly limited group of Things. The features that I can think of (in no particular order) are:

1. **Interactive**. I can use and reuse them, they aren't static. I suppose another word for this might be **Living**.
2. **Joyous**. Using them brings [[Value]] into my life, and this value is often experienced as joy.
3. **Encompassing**. As stated above, these notes encompass a lot of things within their borders (there I go, using physical location based language again..).
4. **Expansive**. They are built to grow, to expand, to change. Not only in a living sense, but also in way that allows for relationships to shift.
5. **Discoverable**. If I'm doing things *correctly* then notes should always be discoverable. Another word for this might be **Serendipitous**.

## What's Most Important to Me?

Another what that I encounter this question is, *why* worry about this? What's the point? I think that if i can develop some kind of framing device, things will start to "click" and call into place a lot more. After all, the vast majority of the body of content in these notes are made up of words and language, so it stands to reason that spending some time to figure out the language to hold it and understand it is important.

So, what's most important?

If I had to really describe (and i guess I'm asking myself to) I'd like something that can unify all of the different structures with all of the different contents; I'd like the form to influence the function, and vice versa. In a perfect version of this system, there's an interplay between the way the thing is built and the things that it builds.

So what does that look like? Well, I think that inspired by the language in the article [[20220411214512-A-Brief-History-and-Ethos-of-the-Digital-Garden]] I like the some of the metaphors there. Specifically:

![[20220411214512-A-Brief-History-and-Ethos-of-the-Digital-Garden#^d18193]]

"The Garden is the web as topology." That's very powerful to me; it's why I took the time to quote it!

It speaks to what I'm saying; arrangement and rearrangement.

Though in many ways I do have a [[1.f Digital Garden]] that is growing, I don't feel like that's, well, quite *encompassing enough* for what I'm saying. So I think that I'll have to expand it.

## Vault as Topology

I think that the vault is a topological entity. Reminds me of what #people/Gilles_Deleuze called "the body without organs," though not as an entity that obstructs the Real from us. Rather, my notes are a *collection of points*.

Certain points are "closer" to other points, are related by certain types of features, and like points cluster in certain areas, attracted by the same forces.

I also like the idea of using elevation as a framing tool, too; certain things are above or below a certain level, and that creates different conditions in its "environment," whatever that might mean.

This needs a bit more development, but I feel like I'm getting closer to actually making some headway on this.
