# 3.a The Narwhal Bacons at Midnight

Is there a phrase or a phase more [[cringe]]? To me, this is what it felt like to be a millennial on the internet; even though it was confined to [[Reddit]], which felt *so niche* at the time, the phrase became such a huge part of its identity that to me it's irrevocable.

It's a sort of crystallized version of all the trappings of early oughts internet; LOLcow, "so random," FML and so on. People were *excited* to use the internet. It was a place to go. [[1. Having a sense of place is key to happiness]] and they found that place, for a time at least.

Now [[6. The internet is insane]] and it's latched onto our lives like a parasite, or a male anglerfish; slowly leeching resources, but providing value, until we eventually subsume it. Only, this subsuming is directed by oligarchic tech-bros that don't care about us, because [[3.a1 Technology doesn't care about us]] unless we *make it* care.
