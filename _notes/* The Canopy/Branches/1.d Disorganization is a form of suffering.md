# 1.d Disorganization is a Form of Suffering

To be disorganized is normal, probably a little healthy too. But it carries a weight, or a series of weights, that we have to carry around with us. Disorganization causes [[20220519000643-Friction]] and friction leeches energy. 

To accept this unthinkingly is to invite suffering into our lives, and while I think [[1.d1 Productive struggle is great]] I think that we have to be very careful about what kinds of suffering we accept. 

I'm *not* saying that no one should ever be disorganized, or that to live in such a way is to be considered a failure. The only guarantee in life is suffering, and the "choice" we have is in what variety or flavor it takes.

That being said, [[4.b1b PKM cannot save you]].
