# 5.a1a I'm Tired of Mediating Relationships Through a Screen

It feels so… Wrong to me somehow. Maybe because when I’m feeling curmudgeonly I can’t help but be all [[1.b1a1 Phone bad, grass good]].

I guess I don’t think that it’s *bad* to do, but I feel like [[6.b2 It's embarrassing to post on social media]] and I’m a certified yearner; I’m downright wistful.

It’s not just me. [[Dumb stuff is back]].
