# 1.c Nostalgia Can Be Short-Term

Thins like "nostalgia" don't have to only refer to things in our deep past, but can reference things that have happened to us fairly recently.

I believe that what needs to happen to give rise to nostalgia is a series of changes that build upon themselves, creating a feedback loop that adds enough noise to sufficiently obscure the input you started with. In other words, as you internalize these changes and incorporate them into your life and being, they build on each other until you don't recognize yourself or the world around you as compared to before.

I was thinking about this when writing in my daily note [[2024-12-23_Mo|Today]] about how I feel a sort of sense of nostalgia for my [[20220425183231-Obsidian|Obsidian]] vault now that the theme Primary is available again. Even though I started my vault in early 2021, which was only *3 years ago*
