# We Are All Lonely Together

How did this happen? I mean, I know that it’s been written about for what feels like every day for the past 8 years, but I think that there’s a reason why so many people keep coming back to this.

I don’t think that people have ever berm lonelier than they are now. Yes, it’s true [[6. The internet is insane]], and there are many [[10.a Hidden costs of mental illness]] that contribute to this. But [[5.a1 Posting ennui is the new normal]]. We aren’t making plans the same way any more. The [[attention economy]] has commodified connection to the detriment of us all.

I don’t think it’s all [[1.b1a1 Phone bad, grass good]] because [[the good old days weren’t all that good]]. It feels more to me like an unchecked biological agent: loneliness is a natural human emotion, but a lot of modern life is [[Culture as convenience]]. Loneliness is, in a word, very inconvenient.
