# PKM Can Be Intellectual Masturbation

Spurned by conversation in the [[Obsidian-discord]], below is a comment I made:

> [!quote]
> Hmm, it occurs to me that it’s almost like… intellectual masturbation. Is that crass?
>
> It is done purely for enjoyment, can lead to a sense of fulfillment, and is entirely constrained to a sort of developmental cul de sac; never going anywhere, and capable of being disregulated without proper care.

Looking back on how I worded that I can't help but feel a little [[cringe]], but I still stand by it. A lot of folks think that pkm is what they need but [[4.b1b PKM cannot save you]].

Masturbation is fine, even mostly healthy. It's not like doing it is always a bad thing, [[11.b It's okay to feel good]]. But acting like you're doing anything "productive" rather than "enjoyable" is self delusion.
