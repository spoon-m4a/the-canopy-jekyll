# 2. People Are a Process

We tend to define people and personhood as a "fixed" quantity, something that doesn't really change or become altered in a meaningful way. At least, that's what it seems like to me.

I think that it's more insightful and "honest" to describe people as being a thing in process, something that is continually changing before our very eyes.
