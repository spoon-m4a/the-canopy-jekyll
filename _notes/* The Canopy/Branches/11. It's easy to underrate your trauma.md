# 11. It's Easy to Underrate Your Trauma

I was playing at Easy Tiger and talking with #folks/John_Green about music and life and how so many people have, as he said, "complicated relationships with their influences."

it got me thinking about how so many people are walking around, traumatized and trying to make the best of it, and when they are confronted by it they write it off, or diminish it, or do something else that in some way puts off that healing.

The traumas that we carry are real, and have weight. Sometimes we might not be ready to put them down, because to do so is to acknowledge them, and to acknowledge them is to legitimize them, and to legitimize them reminds us that we aren't the people we think we are.
