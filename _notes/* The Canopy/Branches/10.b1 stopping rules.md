# Stopping Rules

"stopping rules" - a thing that causes you to stop whatever activity you're doing. Used in [[th.Computer Science]] to help control flow and prevent errors or direct users. Every time you see a popup that says “are you sure you want to delete this file?” that’s a stopping rule.

I think that stopping rules are important for me in managing [[10.a Hidden costs of mental illness]]. For my particular brand of crazy, stopping rules help me manage my disordered behavior. The keep me on track for what I’m trying to accomplish and interrupt me when I’m in the throes of an episode. We could all stand to have more of them in our lives.
