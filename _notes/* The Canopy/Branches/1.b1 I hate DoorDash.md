# 1.b1 I Hate DoorDash

It makes me feel like I'm in every neo-liberals's favorite feel-good dystopia, Wall-E.

Never [[experience lack sometimes]]. Never go without. Commiserate with your friends about how the gig economy is slowly eating us alive, economically and psychically, before you redeem your $5 off coupon for DashPass.

I'm no better of course; I'm not saying that I don't participate in [[lateral exploitation]] from time to time. But [[1.b1a We are all lonely together]] and technology only understands [[20221014171207-The-simplest-form-of-choice]]; you are either in or out, on or off, interested or not, freeloading or paying.

I guess what I'm saying is that there isn't a great way to engineer chance encounters and unexpected opportunities that come when directly interacting with people, and this just feels bad to me. Probably because [[5.a1a I'm tired of mediating relationships through a screen]], and because [[6. The internet is insane]].
