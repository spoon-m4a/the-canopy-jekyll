# 6.f1 The Internet Flattens Things Out

Everything on the internet is [[5.a1a I'm tired of mediating relationships through a screen| mediated through a screen]], and the only information we've been able to reliably transmit in a digital way are certain specific audiovisual things.

As a result, things feel "flattened" in a weird way. We get absorbed by [[monoculture]], and the rough edges of things are smoothed out by the desire of web platforms to attract users and extract value from them.

The internet feels dead because it *is* dead. I mean, "link rot" is an actual thing. Webpages require upkeep to continue living, and most of them have died like someone with brain death; automatic processes that continue on, unaware that there is no mind to direct them. Often, devs perform mercy killings by letting them pass "peacefully," A.K.A not registering their domain when it expires.
