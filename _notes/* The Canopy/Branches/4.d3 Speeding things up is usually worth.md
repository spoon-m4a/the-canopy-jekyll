# 4.d3 Speeding Things up is Usually Worth

Emphasis on “usually.”

Taking the time to optimize is a great idea, and setting aside the time to do that is often a valuable part of ongoing interaction with something. It encourages me to actually think of what a situation or system needs, which can prompt further insight into how something works, or what’s not working. [[4.d3b Time is worth less than frustration]].

Contrast with [[4.d3a Sometimes slow is fast]].
