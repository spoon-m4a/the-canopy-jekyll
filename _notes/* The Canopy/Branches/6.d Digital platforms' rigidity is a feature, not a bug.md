# Digital Platforms Rigidity is a Feature, Not a Bug

Because computers are necessary constrained, their occupants are held captive within their environments.

These constraints provide a resource, because [[Limitation can generate resources]] and [[Creativity needs guardrails]]. Like with all resources, though, they are vulnerable to exploitation and profit motives.

Tech companies know this. They’re interested in strip mining us, using our time and attention as commodities.

It’s not pointless to complain about how rigid and boxed in we are when we use technology, but it is pointless to pretend like this wasn’t the plan all along.
