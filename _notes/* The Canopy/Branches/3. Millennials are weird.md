# 3. Millennials Are Weird

It's funny that millenial is starting to be used as an insult.[^1]

I don't blame the (primarily zoomer) people that use it that way, though; I mean, have you *seen* what they used to psot onlne?

I think that I'm considered a millennial, though I think I'm tecnically more of a "Zillennial" (barf) becasue I am on the tail end of that particular cohort. And man, they're (we're?) kind of weird.

For example, millennials are the first (and so far, the last) generation to actually have a pretty functional knowledge of computers. Gen X and Boomers didn't know what the hell was going on because they were new. Zoomers and Gen Alpha don't know what's going on because they've never not been around.

Millennials are responsible for the best parts of the modern internet (even though [[6. The internet is insane]]), as well as the [[20240217192747-The-internet-is-a-seasonal-place#Nothing Gold Can Stay|ensittification]] of it.

[^1]: I say "starting" like it hasn't been that way for the past 6 years at least.
