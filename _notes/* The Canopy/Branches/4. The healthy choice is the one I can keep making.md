# 4. The Healthy Choice is the One I Can Keep Making

I have to really keep this in mind. Because of my bipolar disorder (or whatever it is that I have) I can really end up tolerating a lot of risk and uncertainty that’s not always good.

I have to keep *sustainability* in mind.

I’ve been struggling with this lately. Probably because [[4.a Stress makes people crazy]] and I’ve been stressed.
