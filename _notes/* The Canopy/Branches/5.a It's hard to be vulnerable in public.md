# 5.a It's Hard to Be Vulnerable in Public

I think that this is a big part of why "[[5.a1 Posting ennui is the new normal]]" is a thing. It's hard to be a pubkic figure, and because [[6. The internet is insane]] it drives that to an extreme.

I think that it ends up leaving those of us who use [[6.a The (anti)social internet]] regularly feeling like we are simultaneously on stage, and lost in the crowd; it's pointless to post because *everyone else* is posting, and embarrassing to post because *everyone else* is watching. It's like a [[panopticon]] or something
