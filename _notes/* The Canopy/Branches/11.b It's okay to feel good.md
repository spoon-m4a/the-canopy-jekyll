# 11.b It's Okay to Feel Good

It's one of those things that feels obvious, but somehow isn't. It needs to be stated again and again. You don't have to be "productive" all the time. While [[1.d1 Productive struggle is great]] I think that unproductive relaxation is really important.

I know that my life in [[th.Music]] has made me feel like if i'm not spending time practicing or working on stuff then I'm a failure, or I'm not living up to my potential, or whatever other story I'm telling myself, but what ends up happening is that I become absolutely *desperate* for solace, and it causes me to behave poorly and become dysregulated (And [[A dysregulated mind is a dysregulated body]]).

One of the ways I know [[11.a I am traumatized]] is because I have a hard time believing this as deeply as I should.
