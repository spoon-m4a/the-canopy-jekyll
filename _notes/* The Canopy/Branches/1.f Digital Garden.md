# Digital Garden

As I encounter and learn to understand this term, I find that I seem to be more and more drawn to it. It seems to be what I've always wanted; something I've been missing for a long time.

For more in-depth info, see: [[20220411214512-A-Brief-History-and-Ethos-of-the-Digital-Garden]]

Some questions for me:

What do I want to put in the garden? What would I like to plant?

What plants am I interested in cultivating?

I'm working on on of my own, too! Thanks to a somewhat unexpected find on [[Reddit]] I've discovered a plugin specifically designed for obsidian to self-publish a digital garden. It's a little janky, and it's not as customizable as I'd really like it to be, but I think it's a step in the right direction. For now, I've made a note as my landing page: [[+ Entrance]]..
