# Phone Bad, Grass Good

[[3.a1 Technology doesn't care about us]]. Sometimes we just need to get off the damn phone. [[5.a1a I'm tired of mediating relationships through a screen]] and a lot of people are as well.

[[1.b1 I hate DoorDash]] because it is opposed to the idea that we can find [[value]] other places. [[Endless growth feels endless in digital spaces]] which is why I think digital platforms are where the growth edge has been for the past quarter century.

[[6.d Digital platforms' rigidity is a feature, not a bug]] that can’t be replicated by the unconstrained nature of just being *outside.* Yes, I know that any outdoor space we inhabit has been curated by people we don’t know, but most of the time we are able to exercise some form of agency at least, or to use the space on creative ways.

More than that, though, is the familiarity we have with space. [[We’re designed for three dimensional living]].
