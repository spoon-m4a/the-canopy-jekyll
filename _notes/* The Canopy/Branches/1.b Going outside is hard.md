Ever since the [[covid-19]] pandemic, homebodies have won out. We’ve become so accustomed to getting everything we need through a screen that we undervalue the intangible benefits we get from touching grass.

It’s so much harder to exist in physical space as it gets replaced with digital space. I think this is probably on part because [[6.d Digital platforms' rigidity is a feature, not a bug]], but also because [[5.a It's hard to be vulnerable in public]].
