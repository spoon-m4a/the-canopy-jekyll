# 4.b We All Have Digital Laundry

We have digital laundry, and it piles up the same way *actual* laundry does. If I don’t spend the time to actually sort through some of these piles, get this mess at least somewhat sorted, then it gets away from me before long.

It’s cliché, but I’ve found that actually getting dressed and going somewhere really helps me out. I’m going to try and incorporate that into my list of things to try every so often.

I feel like for me I haven’t had the chance (or really motive) to exercise that particular response because the nature of my work is sufficiently space restricted, so I kind of take what I can get.
