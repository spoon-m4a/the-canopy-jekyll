# Naming is a Political Act as Much as a Poetic One

What it says on the tin. First encountered [here](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) in an article on the [[1.f Digital Garden]] as a way of structuring information on the web.

When I think about that, it resonates very truly for me; to name a thing is an act of describing it to the world around it. You need a sense of **Self** and a contrasting sense of **Other** to have a name.

[[Politics]] as we know it are very much about the tension of Self/Other; American politics in particular.
