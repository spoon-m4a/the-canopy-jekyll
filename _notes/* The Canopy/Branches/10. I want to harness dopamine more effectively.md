# 10. I Want to Harness Dopamine More Effectively

Because of my various [[10.a Hidden costs of mental illness]] I feel compelled to figure this out.

Dopamine is more than just a neurotransmitter; I mean it more as an important fact of life, something that I’m grappling with daily.

There are a lot of things in the world today that are meant to generate and then capture dopamine; it’s safe to say that huge sectors are ruled entirely by this process (and slightly less safe to say that it *all* is related to it…)

I would like to come up with ways to harness the dopamine that my brain generates in such a way that it enables me, rather than what it does currently (disables me)
