# 4.b1b PKM Cannot Save You

A lot of people (myself included) are looking for the thing that will save them; the thing that will make their problems disappear or at least feel like they are in control. I don't want to make it sound like there's anything wrong with the impulse, and I don't even necessarily think that the people who profit off of that are doing something wrong (though there are definitely some lines that feel a little… Suspicious [^1]).

Personal knowledge management will not be that thing anymore than mindfulness, exercise, religion, or therapy will. Those things are awesome, and transformative, but you have to ask *what is being transformed*? If the answer is "you," then you have to give yourself entirely to the process, and that's hard to do. But manageable.

If the answer is instead something like "my habits," or "my thoughts" or something like that, you're in better shape, but you still have to put the energy into the system in order to provide the fuel it needs to enact that change.

In other words, it is a way of *saving yourself*.
