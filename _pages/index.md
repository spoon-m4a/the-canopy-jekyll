# Landing

This is my [[1.f Digital Garden]]. This is a public-facing collection of notes that I've either made or borrowed.

These are considered "working" or "[[Evergreen notes]]". I am adding to them over time, and it is in a constant state of flux, revision, and rethinking. Shamelessly ~~stealing from~~ inspired by #people/Andy_Matuschak. You can see his collection here: https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes.

You'll see links all over the place; sometimes they are internal, to other notes in the canopy, and sometimes they are external. Click on any of them.

In my head, the narrative framework for this collection is a forest. The notes are intersecting roots and branches, weaving together and making the whole more robust. I call it The Canopy.

The canopy is a lot bigger than what is here (I have maybe 1000 or so different notes?) but this is what I feel comfortable sharing so far. Mostly I just have to get around to publishing the old ones lol. The goal is to get them all up and properly integrated.

## How to Get Around

There is deliberately a limited amount of hierarchical structure here; this is "home" but only because it's nice to have a consistent landing page. You should think of every page as equal to every other page; some will be more interesting, some less, and that's okay.

That said, there are a few navigational aids to help find your way through the garden. You can think of them sort of like desire paths ([[1.e Desire paths are everywhere]]); they're paths that (if done correctly) organically arise out of some need.

Like some desire trails, the links sometimes point to dead ends. Either I haven't written that note yet, so I'm leaving a link for later, or I just haven't gotten around to moving that note over.

You can look at the [[Branch Map]] for a big picture of my more fleshed out/processed stuff. It isn't exhaustive, by any means, but I find it kind of cool.

### Signposts

#### Branches and Intersections

You'll see `up::` for a lot of notes. All that means is that the note you're reading is a "branch" of the pertinent `up::` note. This can help you find things that are related to what you're reading now, as well as help ensure that ideas don't get lost as easily.

Sometimes you'll see `X::` in a note. All that means is that the linked note is in some way "crossing" the note you're reading. It's a way to signify that these two share some sort of intersection. I don't use this as much, but it happens. I find it's helpful to firm up those links, make them a little more real.

There are also some notes that function as intersections with branching paths. The term I use for this is Trailhead, since they help you find a way in. I sort of make them on the fly as needed, but here are a few:

- [[th.Concepts]] can point you to interesting ideas I've encountered and decided to write about.
- [[th.Mind]] is a collection of stuff related to the mind and thinking.
- [[th.PKM]] has resources on theory of PKM, as well as some of my opinions on it.
- [[th.Art]] leads to various things that are artistic in nature. I make a lot of art, and experience a lot of art.
- [[th.Interests]] are more or less activities and topics in which I participate, in some way.

I haven't kept up with them as much as I'd like, so they need a little love and care (like any good trailhead). They aren't the defined ways around notes, either, just well worn paths.

#### UIDs

Each note has a unique identifier (UID), displayed at the top of the note (and sometimes in the inline title of a linked note). I use that for searching, ensuring that notes have unique titles, and because it gives each note a permanent address (in the same way that a business might change but remain at the same address, I can ensure that my links are less likely to break).

Practically speaking, this is useful because I often write down the ID in a physical location (like my bullet journal) and it's good to be able to have them communicate without me worrying about renaming files.

You'll also see that a lot of notes have an alphanumeric prefix (like the beginning of [[4.b1b PKM cannot save you]]). That's taken from #people/Niklas_Luhman's "Folgezettel" (or "following note") organization for his Zettelkasten (which is kind of what this is, I talk about it a little in [[20220409085155-Principles-of-Zettelkasten]]). Basically, it's just a way to track a note along a path. They aren't listed in order of importance, they're just ways of causing me to think of how notes can intersect.

I've recently changed how I do identifiers, so it's likely that some things will look out of place or different. All in due time.

#### Tags

There are various tags that I use, and they have different purposes.

Tags with underscores in front of them are **structural***. That is, they are about metadata.

- `_type/` tags reference what type of note the file is; is it an atom, a tiny unit of information? Is it a note, a larger unit of information designed to be read or understand something? Is it an article, a note designed to incorporate other notes to make some sort of argument or explain something?
- `_status/` tags reference the, well, status of that note. Most things published here *should* be `_status/Leafing` but many are unfinished, or Budding. Occasionally there'll be something that's` _status/Pruning` but I hope not. You'll also sometimes find a `_status/Fluid` tag that means that the nature of the note changes overtime, and trying to pin it down wouldn't be useful.
- `_form/` tags are probably the most abstract. You can see more about that in [[Symbolic processes]]. I'm not sure how useful it'll be for you, but [[10.b Narrative devices are helpful for living]] and these are some of mine.

## Okay, but Why?

Well, that'sâ€¦ A good question. I guess I'm doing this because I like it, because I think my ideas are worth sharing, and because I want accountability and meaning for all the thinking and writing that I do. I don't know why *you're* here, but that's okay. Stay as long (or as little) as you want.
